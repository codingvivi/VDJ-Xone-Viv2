# Xone Viv2 - A 2x2 deck, hybrid setup VDJ mapping

The mapping I use for my 2 K2s with VirtualDJ.
Meant for use with either an external mixer,
or a separate controller representing a mixer.
Opinionated, yet feature rich.
Consists of two files,
one for each controller.

WIP.

## Features:

### 16 pages of functionality

instead of using the mode button to cycle through 3 mere pages,
it shows a menu page
with buttons A-P representing a sub-menu each.
This means 16 pages in total,
some still assignable.
The shift button could allow for 16 more.

### Consistent, square deck control layout

The deck control pages of each of the controllers
controls 2 decks.
Decks are laid out vertically,
exactly like they are shown in Virtual DJ.
Side by side the arrangement is:

| Left K2 | Right K2 |
| ------- | -------- |
| Deck 1  | Deck 2   |
| Deck 3  | Deck 4   |

Furthermore,
deck controls themselves are not mirrored
(like they would be with VirtualDJ's automatic deck assignment).
This reduces mental overhead and missinputs.

# Extensive track browser filtering
