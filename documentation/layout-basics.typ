== Layout basics
Latch layers functionality mimics setting 2,
that is, the latch layer button changes the functionality of the buttons A-P.
However, instead of cycling through 3 layers
by repeatedly pressing the latch layer button,
the button brings you to a menu page
where each of the buttons A-P represents a unique layer. 
This makes for a total of 16 layers,
with 16 more theoretically possible
using the shift button.
